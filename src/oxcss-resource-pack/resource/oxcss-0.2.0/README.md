# OxCSS

**Not much to see here yet, but thanks for stopping by!**

___

Aiming to make OxCSS be a quick-use style library, but less deterministic than Twitter Bootstrap.

Hoping to make OxCSS easy to add to existing web projects by using data attributes and careful naming.

___

### Color

Text colors:
```
<div data-ox-text-color="common-red"> I have red text </div>
```

Background colors:
```
<div data-ox-bg-color="md-light-green-A400"> I have a green background </div>
```

Using color value from list of available colors. 

(Currently only have a few common colors, and the Material Design colors added) 


i.e. for Material Design Yellow:
